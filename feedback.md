## Skeleton Code feedback - 11/20

Layout looks good so far. Based on what's here and what we talked about in class, I suspect you won't actually need to use Vue - you certianly can, but it might be more complicated than necessary for what you're doing! Just Boostrap modules alone might do the trick (in particular for your photo carousel).  
Some of these steps that you outlined might require multiple substeps and or clarifications. For example, when it comes to jacking the car up, you probably want to have multiple photos that show not only the jack operation but also the jack point under the chassis.  
Finally, think about the styling for the step-by-step buttons. Should these have thumbnail images? Should they be numbered?
