## Description
We are going to demonstrate how to change a tire. We will use a variety of images
to walk the user through the steps that it takes to change a tire. We will have images, descriptions,
and buttons for the user to click. We also will include a video of a tire being changed in real time.
Clicking will move the process along

11/1 update: We are going to have 3 components (header, text, pic, steps). These components will hold the information that changes with each step. The steps component that will be titled buttons that change when clicked on to indicate ths users current position. 

11/14 updated decription: We are going to teach users how to change a tire. We will include images that show the process through step by step. Along with these images there will be descriptions explaining each step. We are addding buttons and clicking to allow users to navigate step by step. We decided to use a grid layout. We added boxes for the container navigation. We will have to put buttons in the box along with the text. We made sketches of our initial designs and our final designs that show a grid layout for users to easily navigate through our website. We are wondering how we are going to style our grid so that we can have our components in the correct places. We are hoping to put our list of buttons on the right side of the page, and it will cover the entire length (vertically) of the page, and just less than a quarter of the page (horizontally). We have set up buttons so users can click through each step. We are working on making our website more interactive. We are thinking about adding a quiz for the user after they've seen the process of how to change a tire. We were also thinking of adding a list of common things that could go wrong and a safety warning for certain steps with the tools and cars location. 


Libraries we are expecting to use in our project:
