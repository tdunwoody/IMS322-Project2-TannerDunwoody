## Skeleton Code feedback - 11/20

Layout looks good so far. Based on what's here and what we talked about in class, I suspect you won't actually need to use Vue - you certianly can, but it might be more complicated than necessary for what you're doing! Just Boostrap modules alone might do the trick (in particular for your photo carousel).  
Some of these steps that you outlined might require multiple substeps and or clarifications. For example, when it comes to jacking the car up, you probably want to have multiple photos that show not only the jack operation but also the jack point under the chassis.  
Finally, think about the styling for the step-by-step buttons. Should these have thumbnail images? Should they be numbered?

## Rough Draft comments - 12/1
### Interaction comments
- The interaction works and is pretty simple so far (clicking buttons reveals the photo/text of that step). Obvioulsy, adding a quiz will introduce another level of interaction.
- What other elements can be added? Can you embed demo videos for each step so that users can see it in motion, not just still images?
### General comments
There are several general layout/styling things that I would suggest to polish this up and make it look more finished and professional:
- Selecting a non-default font.
- If it's not possible to make the images all the same size shape, then at least get them centered in their container.
- The buttons also seem a little awkward stuck to the top of their div - I would center those, too.
Nice job setting up the grid layout!
