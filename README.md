## Description
We are going to demonstrate how to change a tire. We will use a variety of images
to walk the user through the steps that it takes to change a tire. We will have images, descriptions,
and buttons for the user to click. We also will include a video of a tire being changed in real time.
Clicking will move the process along

11/1 update: We are going to have 3 components (header, text, pic, steps). These components will hold the information that changes with each step. The steps component that will be titled buttons that change when clicked on to indicate ths users current position.
